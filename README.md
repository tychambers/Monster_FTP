Hi All,

This is an FTP client. It's similiar to WinSCP you can download and upload files from an FTP server. There is also a 
setting that allows you to connect to a Postgresql DB and record all of the uploads and downloads that are being performed.
Then you can export all of these transactions to CSV using pandas. The CSV will be in the current directory (same directory as the application).
