HI,

This is an FTP client, it also interfaces with Postgresql to keep track of the file uploads and will export these to a CSV using pandas.
There is a logging feature that logs any transfer failures, and also the CSV exports to the current directory. You can upload/download from an FTP server
using FTP or SFTP protocols. SFTP has both password and key authentication.
